"""Story 32.6 (AC-1) — UI-safe estimate DTOs the ``/api/estimates`` read endpoint
projects from the internal ``EstimateRecord`` (``models.py``).

This file is the public ⟂ internal split, mirroring ``spools/schemas.py`` ⟂
``spools/models.py``: every DTO is ``ConfigDict(extra="forbid")`` and exposes ONLY
the fields the frontend renders. It deliberately carries NO ``settings_ids`` (the
resolved-profile attribution — internal), NO ``bundle_hash`` / ``stl_hash`` (the
content-addressed reproducibility key — internal), NO raw layer-height /
``filament_max_volumetric_speed`` / temps / density / g-code / Orca key, and NOT the
``SlicerProfileBundle`` itself. That is FR20-PRESET-1 ("the preset never leaks Orca
internals") enforced at the API boundary (the render layer re-enforces it — defense
in depth, AC-5).
