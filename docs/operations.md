# Operations Runbook

> **Note:** Several scripts referenced in this runbook (`infra/scripts/deploy.sh`, `infra/scripts/backup-sqlite.sh`, `infra/scripts/gen-htpasswd.sh`) and the production stack are introduced in Phase 12 of the implementation plan and may not exist yet. These instructions reflect the intended deployment workflow.

## Push gate & hook runbook

Two gates guard quality (full policy + rationale in AGENTS.md § "Pre-push hook
policy & gate evidence"):

- **Lean pre-push hook** (`.githooks/pre-push`, opt-in via `git config
  core.hooksPath .githooks`) — fast, deterministic, low-output checks run on
  every `git push`: `git diff --check`, ruff format+check (`apps/api` +
  `workers/render`), web typecheck + lint, and the cheap drift gates
  (`check-settings-env-compose.py`, `uv lock --check`,
  `check-local-env-secrets.sh`). Seconds, a few output lines. Heavy stages are
  NOT here.
- **Full gate** (`infra/scripts/check-all.sh`) — the local CI-equivalent
  (no hosted CI). Everything the lean hook runs **plus** the web production
  build, vitest, pytest (api + worker + infra/scripts), and Playwright visual
  regression. **Required** before any ff-merge to `main` and before deploy.

### Full-gate evidence logs

Run the full gate with `tee` so the all-green evidence is recoverable:

```bash
mkdir -p .hermes/run-logs && infra/scripts/check-all.sh 2>&1 | tee .hermes/run-logs/check-all-$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).log
```

`.hermes/run-logs/` is gitignored local scratch (the logs reference internal
hosts/paths). Cite the exact log path back to the controller at story closeout.
`check-all.sh` prints `all green.` and exits 0 on a clean standalone run; a
non-zero exit lists the failed stages.

### Output / transport-only hook failures

The old hook exec'd the full aggregate on every push; its multi-megabyte stdout
intermittently caused **SIGPIPE / exit-141-after-success** on Hermes/SSH pushes
(checks went green, then a downstream pipe closed and the hook died with 141).
The lean hook removes that by staying quiet on the happy path. On unprovisioned clones it may skip missing local toolchain stages; the standalone full gate remains authoritative for closeout/merge/deploy. If you still hit
a transport/output-only abort:

1. The lean hook printed only `OK` lines (no `XX`) but the push aborted with
   exit 141 / a truncated-pipe error → this is the output-pipe failure mode,
   not a check failure.
2. Re-run the relevant check (or the full gate) standalone and tee the evidence
   to `.hermes/run-logs/` (above). Confirm all-green.
3. Only then push once with `git push --no-verify`. This is a one-shot escape
   for the transport/output failure mode **after** standalone all-green
   evidence — never a way to skip a red gate.

If the hook printed an `XX <stage>` line, that is a **real** failure: fix the
underlying issue and re-push. Do not `--no-verify` past a genuine red stage.

## Deploy to `.190`

```bash
bash infra/scripts/deploy.sh
```

This script builds images locally, ships them to `.190` via SSH, restarts the docker-compose stack, and runs alembic migrations to bring the schema in sync.

### Slicer-worker overlay deploy (SW-DEPLOY-1)

The slicer-worker (Initiative 20 / Epic 32) is a **configs-side overlay**, not part of the base stack `deploy.sh` builds. Its image `portal-slicer-worker:0.1.0` is built `FROM portal-api:0.1.0` from a recipe owned by the **configs repo** on `.190`:

- `/mnt/raid/configs/docker-compose-recipes/workers/slicer-worker.Dockerfile`
- `/mnt/raid/configs/docker-compose-recipes/workers/slicer-worker.yml` (service + profile `slicer-worker`)

Because the overlay layers on the `portal-api` base, any `apps/api/**` change rebuilds `portal-api` but leaves the overlay running the **old** image — a silent API↔worker version skew that only surfaces when a slice/estimate job runs (this is the failure that hit Story 32.3). `deploy.sh` now closes that gap automatically: after the base stack is up + migrated it runs

```bash
infra/scripts/slicer-worker-overlay.sh deploy
```

which **self-scopes** off `infra/.last-deploy-sha` (the range being deployed), and:

1. **detects** whether the range touches `apps/api/**` (the `portal-api` base) — if not, it skips (no-op, exit 0);
2. **rebuilds** `portal-slicer-worker:0.1.0` from the configs Dockerfile and restarts the overlay service on the fresh base;
3. **smokes** the running container: importlib presence for `app.modules.slicer.{gcode_parse,estimate_store,recompute,overrides,spoolman_invalidation}`, the `slicer_estimate_store_dir` + `slicer_orca_bin` Settings, an Orca binary `--help` reachability check (no real slice), and a `parse_gcode_metadata` / `map_filament_extra` functional smoke.

**Fatality:** **any** overlay rebuild/restart/smoke failure is fatal and aborts the deploy. The rebuild is deliberately not best-effort — a swallowed `docker build` failure would leave the old image running and the presence-based smoke would pass against stale-but-present modules (the exact silent skew this exists to prevent). Because the abort happens before the state-file write, a failed run does **not** advance `infra/.last-deploy-sha`. If the overlay simply isn't deployed on a given host, opt out with `SKIP_SLICER_WORKER=1` rather than relying on a tolerated error.

**Switches (env vars):**

| Var | Effect |
|---|---|
| `SKIP_SLICER_WORKER=1` | Hard opt-out — the overlay phase does nothing, exit 0. |
| `FORCE_SLICER_WORKER_REBUILD=1` | Force "rebuild needed" regardless of the range. Use to close the 32.4/32.5 overlay gate manually, or after any out-of-band `portal-api` rebuild. |
| `DRY_RUN=1` | Print the fully-resolved `ssh … docker build …` / `… exec` commands + smoke payload; run no SSH/Docker. The safe local inspection path on `.170`. |
| `SLICER_OVERLAY_RECIPE_DIR`, `SLICER_OVERLAY_DOCKERFILE`, `SLICER_OVERLAY_COMPOSE_FILE`, `SLICER_WORKER_IMAGE`, `SLICER_WORKER_SERVICE`, `SLICER_WORKER_PROFILE` | Override the configs-side recipe paths / image tag / service / profile if the configs repo relocates them. The recipe is **never vendored** into this repo. |

**Manual fallback** (the pre-automation recipe, e.g. to close the gate by hand on `.190`):

```bash
# rebuild the overlay on the fresh portal-api base, then restart it:
ssh -p 30022 ezop@192.168.2.190 \
  "docker build -f /mnt/raid/configs/docker-compose-recipes/workers/slicer-worker.Dockerfile \
     -t portal-slicer-worker:0.1.0 /mnt/raid/configs/docker-compose-recipes/workers"
ssh -p 30022 ezop@192.168.2.190 \
  "cd /mnt/raid/docker-compose/3d-portal && docker compose --env-file .env \
     -f docker-compose.yml -f /mnt/raid/configs/docker-compose-recipes/workers/slicer-worker.yml \
     --profile slicer-worker up -d slicer-worker"
# or, equivalently, from this repo:
FORCE_SLICER_WORKER_REBUILD=1 bash infra/scripts/slicer-worker-overlay.sh deploy
```

The detection + command-generation logic is unit-tested (no Docker/SSH) in `infra/scripts/tests/test_slicer_worker_overlay.py`; the live rebuild + in-container smoke is exercised by the controller's next slicer-touching deploy on `.190`.

## Catalog (post-SoT)

The portal's source of truth is now the `portal.db` SQLite database on `.190` plus the `portal-content` volume. Models, files, tags, categories, notes, prints, and external links are managed through the admin API (`/api/admin/*`) and reverse-synced from WSL via the agent token + `scripts/hydrate_local_tree.py` (see SoT migration section below). The legacy one-way Windows → `.190` rsync is no longer used.

## First-time setup

**1. Generate htpasswd**

```bash
bash infra/scripts/gen-htpasswd.sh portal '<household-password>'
```

This creates the basic-auth file for nginx to use.

**2. Copy nginx config**

```bash
cp infra/nginx-180/3d-portal.conf ~/repos/configs/nginx/
cd ~/repos/configs && bash sync.sh
```

This deploys the edge proxy config to `.180` and reloads nginx.

**3. Generate JWT secret**

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Store this in `.env.production` as `JWT_SECRET`.

**4. Create GlitchTip project**

See `~/repos/configs/docs/glitchtip-agent-guide.md` for how to create a new project in GlitchTip and get its DSN.

## Backup

SQLite database backup runs nightly via cron on `.190`:

```bash
infra/scripts/backup-sqlite.sh
```

Backups are stored in `/mnt/raid/3d-portal-state/backups/` with 30-day retention (e.g. `portal-2026-04-29.db`).

**Restore:** Stop the api container, copy the backup back into `/mnt/raid/3d-portal-state/portal.db`, and restart the compose stack.

## Failure modes

| Symptom | Check | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `5xx on /api/models` | Check OpenSearch (OTel logs) `service.name=3d-portal-api` for trace | Inspect `docker compose logs api`; database volume must be mounted at `/data/state/portal.db` |
| Share link returns `401` | Confirm `/share/*` and `/api/share/*` bypass blocks present in `~/repos/configs/nginx/3d-portal.conf` | Re-deploy nginx config via `bash sync.sh` in configs repo |
| Render stuck on "running" | Inspect arq worker logs with `docker compose logs worker` | Restart worker; status TTL is 1h so it self-clears |

## Routine operations

**Log in to admin panel**

Open `/login` and use `ADMIN_EMAIL` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from your `.env.production`.

**Revoke a share token**

Via the admin UI (share list, coming in Phase 8), or directly:

```bash
curl -X DELETE https://3d.ezop.ddns.net/api/admin/share/{token} \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN"
```

**Retrigger a render**

```bash
curl -X POST https://3d.ezop.ddns.net/api/admin/models/{model_uuid}/render \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $JWT_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{}'
```

The optional body field `selected_stl_file_ids: []` lets you pin which STLs participate (defaults to `ModelFile.selected_for_render` rows, falling back to the first STL).

**Bulk-enqueue renders for the whole catalog**

When deploying to a fresh content volume (no pre-rendered PNGs), enqueue render jobs for every model in one shot:

```bash
# Get a fresh JWT (admin login via /api/auth/login). Then:
bash infra/scripts/render-all.sh "<bearer-jwt>"
```

**Backfill default-matrix slicer estimates** — Story 35.6 / Initiative 23

When material-default profiles are updated or new models added, backfill the bounded default matrix (Catalog STL × Active Offer × Compatible Material Default):

```bash
# 1. Inspect: list what would be enqueued (no write, no enqueue).
docker compose exec api python3 apps/api/scripts/enqueue_default_matrix_backfill.py --dry-run

# 2. Enqueue: distributes slicing work to the arq slicer-worker.
docker compose exec api python3 apps/api/scripts/enqueue_default_matrix_backfill.py
```

The script is bounded: it only enqueues `default_material_profile` estimates, NEVER `exact_filament_mapping` unless explicitly requested. deduplication via `(stl_hash, bundle_hash)` prevents redundant slices.

**Backfill WebP thumbnail variants (image-kind ModelFiles)** — Story 13.2 / Decision P

After deploying the Story 13.2 thumbnail pipeline (commit shipping `app/workers/generate_thumbnail.py`), legacy image-kind uploads do not yet have the `<storage_path>.thumb.webp` sibling on disk. New uploads auto-enqueue the variant; pre-pipeline files need a one-shot backfill. The variant endpoint silently serves the full-resolution original when the sibling is missing, so the backfill is non-blocking for users — run it whenever it's convenient post-deploy.

```bash
# 1. Inspect: list everything that would be enqueued (no write, no enqueue).
SSH_TARGET=ezope@192.168.2.190 bash infra/scripts/backfill-thumbnails.sh --dry-run --verbose

# 2. Enqueue: distributes Pillow work to the arq worker (fastest path).
SSH_TARGET=ezope@192.168.2.190 bash infra/scripts/backfill-thumbnails.sh

# 3. (alternative) Inline: render in-process inside the api container.
#    Slower but produces deterministic per-file feedback in stdout.
SSH_TARGET=ezope@192.168.2.190 bash infra/scripts/backfill-thumbnails.sh --inline --verbose
```

The script is idempotent — files that already have a `.thumb.webp` sibling are skipped without enqueueing. Re-runs are safe. Watch worker progress with `docker compose logs -f api worker` on the host. NOT auto-fired by `infra/scripts/deploy.sh`: operator runs once post-deploy.

## GlitchTip observability — operator runbook

All three services (web, api, worker) report uncaught errors to a single GlitchTip project at `https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net`, project `3d-portal` in org `homelab`. The DSN is shared across services; events are tagged `service=web|api|render`, `release=<pkg.version>+<git_short_sha>`, `environment=$ENVIRONMENT`.

Frontend symbolication is fully wired as of Epic 3: `@sentry/vite-plugin` injects debug IDs at build time INSIDE the docker stage, source maps upload via chunk-upload, and `verify-symbolication.sh` proves on every deploy that the resolved top frame still matches `^apps/web/src/.+\.tsx?$`.

### Configuration

The DSN lives in two `.env` files:

| Where | Vars | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `.190:/mnt/raid/docker-compose/3d-portal/.env` | `SENTRY_DSN`, `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` | passed to api/worker containers (runtime) and web (build arg) |
| `~/repos/3d-portal/infra/.env` (dev box only) | `SENTRY_DSN`, `VITE_SENTRY_DSN`, `GLITCHTIP_AUTH_TOKEN`, `GLITCHTIP_ORG_SLUG`, `GLITCHTIP_PROJECT_SLUG` | the auth token + slugs power the in-build plugin upload, the CLI manual recovery, and the verify ritual; must NOT be pushed to `.190` |

If the DSN is rotated or the project recreated, update both `.env` files (the public DSN value is identical) and re-deploy. Replacing the auth token is dev-box-only.

### Deploy ritual

`bash infra/scripts/deploy.sh` runs the canonical chain:

1. **Build images locally** — `docker compose build` with `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1`. Inside the `apps/web` build stage, `@sentry/vite-plugin` injects debug IDs into the bundle and uploads source maps via the chunk-upload protocol against `http://192.168.2.190:8800` (LAN HTTP, mandatory for multi-MB chunks). `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` flows in via BuildKit `--mount=type=secret,id=sentry_token,required=true` — token never lands in any image layer (verifiable with `docker history`).
2. **Save and ship** — `docker save | ssh ... docker load` pushes images to `.190`.
3. **Restart stack** — `docker compose up -d` recreates containers.
4. **Alembic migrations** — `docker compose run --rm api alembic upgrade head`.
5. **Verify post-deploy symbolication** — `bash infra/scripts/verify-symbolication.sh` triggers a smoke event via headless Chrome against `https://3d.ezop.ddns.net/?__sentry_smoke=<uuid>`, polls GlitchTip REST for the resolved event, asserts the top frame regex `^apps/web/src/.+\.tsx?$`, and writes `infra/.last-verify` (single-line tab-separated `<ISO-8601>\t<STATUS>\t<release>`).

The verify call is **non-fatal**: deploy.sh exits 0 regardless of verify outcome. The verify result lands in three independent signals (the three-signal failure model — NFR-R3):

- **stdout/stderr warning** — `✓ verify OK` on success (stdout), yellow `→ verify SKIPPED: web image cached…` on TB-005 cache-hit skip (exit 5, stdout), or red `⚠ verify FAILED: <reason>` on failure (stderr), exit-code-mapped per `verify-symbolication.sh`'s FR12 contract (exit 0/1/2/3/4/5).
- **`infra/.last-verify` marker** — `OK` on success, `FAILED` on any non-zero failure exit (1/2/3/4), or `SKIPPED web-image-cached` when the TB-005 staleness gate fires (exit 5). Consumed by the next deploy's stale-verify tripwire (see below). The staleness gate explicitly refuses to overwrite a prior `FAILED` marker — a cache-hit deploy following a broken-symbolication deploy falls through to the full verify path so the failure signal is not erased.
- **Synthetic GlitchTip event** — for exit codes 1 (regex mismatch) and 3 (auth/scope failure), `verify-symbolication.sh` POSTs an envelope event tagged `deploy.verification=failed` to the same DSN as runtime errors. Operator sees it in the same triage path; filter by tag to distinguish meta-failures from real app exceptions.

**Stale-verify tripwire.** At the START of every `deploy.sh` invocation (before the build phase), the script reads `infra/.last-verify` mtime and compares it to HEAD's commit timestamp (`git log -1 --format=%ct HEAD`). If the marker is older than the current HEAD's commit time → a yellow `⚠ stale verify: previous deploy did not record a successful verification` warning prints to stderr (non-fatal). This guards against the "we forgot to run verify" decay scenario (FR16 / NFR-R4).

**Required tools on the dev box** (where `deploy.sh` runs): `docker`, `git`, `node` (via nvm; v22+ for the docker stage, v24+ on host), `jq`, `curl`, `uuidgen`, `timeout`, plus a headless Chrome/Chromium binary (`google-chrome` or `chromium`). The verify script auto-detects the browser; override with `HEADLESS_BROWSER=<binary>` if needed.

### Manual recovery — CLI fallback

When the in-build plugin upload fails (transient GlitchTip 5xx, network glitch, expired token mid-build, or the Phase 0 issue #299 redux), use `infra/scripts/upload-sourcemaps.sh` standalone:

```bash
cd /home/ezop/repos/3d-portal
set -a; source infra/.env; set +a
# Rebuild with maps in dist (the plugin's filesToDeleteAfterUpload removes them by default;
# disable the plugin or use a previously-built dist+maps archive — see the script's --help):
cd apps/web && npm run build && cd ../..
bash infra/scripts/upload-sourcemaps.sh
# Re-run verify to confirm the maps are now resolvable:
bash infra/scripts/verify-symbolication.sh
```

The CLI script uses the official `glitchtip-cli` (Rust, cached at `~/.cache/glitchtip-cli/`, sha256-pinned). It computes `RELEASE = ${pkg.version}+${git_short_sha}` from `apps/web/package.json` + `git rev-parse --short HEAD` — drift-impossible: matches both `apps/web/src/release.ts` (consumed by `Sentry.init`) and the in-build plugin's `release.name`. See `bash infra/scripts/upload-sourcemaps.sh --help` for the full operator guide.

**FR4 hard-fail policy.** If `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is missing or empty in `infra/.env`, the docker build aborts at the BuildKit secret-mount step (`required=true` + non-empty guard in `apps/web/Dockerfile`). NO silent skip — the deploy stops before any image ships. Either set the token or roll back to a previous deploy.

### Token rotation procedure (same-day)

1. Open `https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net/profile/auth-tokens/` on LAN/VPN.
2. Click **+ Create New Token**. Set the scopes per the next subsection (5 scopes total).
3. Copy the new token value.
4. Update `~/repos/3d-portal/infra/.env`: replace the `GLITCHTIP_AUTH_TOKEN` value with the new token. Save (`chmod 600` already applied).
5. Validate end-to-end: `bash infra/scripts/deploy.sh`. The plugin upload + verify ritual both exercise the new token. A green `✓ verify OK` line + `infra/.last-verify` carrying `OK <release>` confirms the token works.
6. Revoke the OLD token in the GlitchTip UI.
7. Record the rotation date inline in this runbook (or in `_bmad-output/project-context.md` as an evergreen log entry).

**Why same-day:** the token has write scope (`event:write`, `project:write`). Quarterly rotation is the baseline; ad-hoc rotation on suspected leak / personnel change should complete within a single operator session.

### Required token scopes (exact list)

The token MUST carry exactly these five scopes:

| Scope | Used by |
|---|---|
| `org:read` | REST queries against `/api/0/organizations/<org>/...` |
| `project:read` | REST queries against `/api/0/projects/<org>/<proj>/...` |
| `project:write` | source-map upload (chunk-upload + assemble) |
| `project:releases` | release record creation/updates during plugin upload |
| `event:write` | `verify-symbolication.sh`'s synthetic alarm event POST (envelope endpoint) |

NOT `org:write`, NOT `org:admin`. Token-scope minimization is NFR-S3; broader scopes are a liability without value.

`event:write` is required by the verify ritual's three-signal failure path (Story 3.1's `emit_alarm` helper). A token that worked under the old 4-scope list will silently fail at the alarm-POST step on regex-mismatch failures — the alarm event won't ingest, leaving only stdout + the `.last-verify FAILED` marker as failure signals. The verify ritual's NFR-R3 three-signal contract requires the fifth scope.

### Triage script usage

> **Status (2026-05-10):** the triage script is Epic 2 scope and ships in **Story 2.5** (currently backlog). The contract below is locked; once the story lands, the section stays accurate.

```bash
bash infra/scripts/glitchtip-triage.sh <issue_id>
```

Returns a paste-ready markdown stub with fixed field order:

- Top frame (`filename:line`)
- Fingerprint
- Route context (`route.pathname`)
- `model.id` (when present)
- Release SHA + commit hash
- Last 5 events (timestamp + message preview)
- Suggested file to edit (top-frame source)
- GlitchTip permalink

Schema is verifiable: `bash infra/scripts/glitchtip-triage.sh --schema | diff -u tests/golden/triage-schema.txt -` returns zero diff on stable contract. Read-only against GlitchTip — no state mutation.

The output is the triage interface for AI agents. Open it in `bmad-quick-dev` or `bmad-create-story` directly; the GlitchTip web UI is the slow path.

### Cross-references

- `~/repos/configs/docs/glitchtip-agent-guide.md` — REST recipes for arbitrary GlitchTip queries (events, issues, releases). Extends what this runbook covers.
- `~/repos/configs/docs/observability-logging-contract.md` — tag taxonomy (ECS-style dotted naming for `service.*`, `deployment.*`, `route.*`, etc.). Project-specific extensions preserve the dotted convention.
- `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/architecture.md` Decision K — verify ritual rationale + three-signal failure model.

### GlitchTip 6.1.x version pin

The verify and CLI flows depend on the GlitchTip 6.1.x REST API surface:

- `GET /api/0/projects/<org>/<proj>/issues/?statsPeriod=5m&query=<tag>:<value>` — issue search by tag (verify ritual's poll target).
- `GET /api/0/issues/<id>/events/latest/` — latest event for an issue.
- `POST /api/0/organizations/<org>/chunk-upload/` + `POST /api/0/organizations/<org>/artifactbundle/assemble/` — modern source-map upload (chunk-upload protocol; replaces the legacy `releases/{version}/files/` endpoint, which returns 405 on this version).
- `POST /api/<project_id>/envelope/` — Sentry-protocol envelope ingest (synthetic alarm events).
- The `release` field surfaces in event JSON as a TAG entry (`.tags[] | select(.key=="release")`), NOT as a top-level `.release` field.

Upgrade to GlitchTip 7.x requires re-validation of all five surfaces (NFR-I1) before re-tagging the runbook. Cite the "Provisioning a fresh project" subsection below for the operator-side test plan; cross-check against the live verify ritual after upgrade.

**Homelab GlitchTip config invariant.** The `glitchtip-worker` container in `/mnt/raid/docker-compose/glitchtip.yml` MUST mount the `glitchtip-uploads` volume at `/code/uploads` — same as the web container. Without it, `assemble_artifacts_task` fails with `FileNotFoundError` and source maps never persist in `sourcecode_debugsymbolbundle`. Discovered + fixed during Story 3.1's dev cycle (2026-05-09); see `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/epic-1-symbolication-regression.md` for full context.

### Trigger a test event

API (deliberate `RuntimeError`, admin-only):

```bash
source infra/.env
TOKEN=$(curl -fsS -X POST http://192.168.2.190:8090/api/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d "{\"email\":\"$ADMIN_EMAIL\",\"password\":\"$ADMIN_PASSWORD\"}" \
  | python3 -c "import sys,json;print(json.load(sys.stdin)['access_token'])")

curl -i -X POST http://192.168.2.190:8090/api/admin/sentry-test \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN"
```

Returns 500. The event lands in GlitchTip within ~5 s tagged `service=api`, `release=$PORTAL_VERSION`, `environment=production`. The `Authorization` header is scrubbed to `[Filtered]` (verify by clicking into the issue).

Worker: enqueue a render for a model whose STL file is missing on disk (e.g. the row exists in `model_file` but the file under `portal-content/` was deleted out-of-band). The catch-all `except Exception` in `render_model` calls `sentry_sdk.capture_exception` once per failure.

Frontend: open `http://192.168.2.190:8090` in a browser, open DevTools console, run `throw new Error("frontend-test")`. Visible in the panel within seconds tagged `service=web`.

### Reading recent issues from CLI

```bash
source infra/.env
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $GLITCHTIP_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  "https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net/api/0/projects/$GLITCHTIP_ORG_SLUG/3d-portal/issues/?statsPeriod=24h" \
  | python3 -c "
import sys, json
for i in json.load(sys.stdin):
    print(f\"[{i['level']}] {i['title']} (count: {i['count']}, last: {i['lastSeen']})\")
"
```

To filter by service:

```bash
... "?statsPeriod=24h&query=service:render" ...
```

### Provisioning a fresh project

If the project ever needs to be recreated (new instance, lost DB, etc.):

1. Read GlitchTip admin creds from `.190:/mnt/raid/docker-compose/glitchtip.env` (`DJANGO_SUPERUSER_EMAIL`, `DJANGO_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`).

2. The login endpoint uses django-allauth headless API. Fetch the CSRF cookie first:

```bash
curl -s -c /tmp/gt-cookies.txt https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net/_allauth/browser/v1/config >/dev/null
CSRF=$(grep csrftoken /tmp/gt-cookies.txt | awk '{print $7}')

curl -s -b /tmp/gt-cookies.txt -c /tmp/gt-cookies.txt \
  -X POST https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net/_allauth/browser/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Referer: https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net" \
  -H "Origin: https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net" \
  -H "X-CSRFTOKEN: $CSRF" \
  -d '{"email":"<EMAIL>","password":"<PASSWORD>"}'
```

3. With the session cookie, list orgs/teams and create the project:

```bash
CSRF=$(grep csrftoken /tmp/gt-cookies.txt | awk '{print $7}')
curl -s -b /tmp/gt-cookies.txt -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-CSRFTOKEN: $CSRF" \
  -H "Referer: https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net" \
  https://glitchtip.ezop.ddns.net/api/0/teams/<ORG>/<TEAM>/projects/ \
  -d '{"name":"3d-portal","platform":"javascript-react"}'
```

4. Get the DSN:

```bash

## SoT migration — operational state (post Slice 2 series)

**As of 2026-05-05**, the SoT migration (Slices 2A-2D) is done AND the
UI rewrite (Slices 3A-3F) is done. The portal database on `.190` now
holds the canonical catalog: 89 models, 821 binary files (2.8 GB across
`/mnt/raid/3d-portal-content/`), 243 deduplicated tags, 43 categories,
62 external links, 31 notes, 26 print records. The frontend at
`https://3d.ezop.ddns.net/` consumes only `/api/*` (the SoT surface).

**Legacy cleanup completed on 2026-05-06**: `/api/catalog/*`,
`/api/files/*`, `/api/admin/refresh-catalog`,
`/api/admin/render/{string-id}`, the legacy thumbnail-override
endpoints, `CatalogService`, the `thumbnailoverride` and
`renderselection` tables, and the WSL `sync-data.sh` script were all
removed once log inspection confirmed zero non-test callers.

**E4.4-followup (2026-05-11) retired the migration scripts entirely.**
`Model.legacy_id` was dropped via Alembic migration `0010_drop_model_legacy_id.py`;
`scripts/migrate_from_index_json.py`, `scripts/backfill_legacy_renders.py`,
`scripts/backfill_iso_thumbnail.py`, and `scripts/fix_legacy_render_names.py`
were `git rm`'d. Disaster recovery references the pre-DROP snapshot at
`docs/migration-reports/2026-05-11-legacy-id-snapshot.json` (89 rows,
~5 KB) for the legacy-id ↔ model.id mapping; full re-import from a
Nextcloud snapshot would have to be reconstructed manually (or by
checking out commit `d92e551` — the original SoT migration entry
point — from git history).

### UI rewrite delivered (Slices 3A-3F)

- **3A — Auth + API context.** `AuthContext` + `useAuth()` hook. `GET /api/auth/me` accepts any authenticated role. SoT TypeScript types in `apps/web/src/lib/api-types.ts`.
- **3B — List view rebuild.** `CategoryTreeSidebar` (recursive expandable tree) + `FilterRibbon` (search, tag chips, status, source, sort). Server-side filters and offset/limit pagination. `/api/models` extended with `category_ids[]`, `tag_ids[]` (AND), `source`, `sort` enum.
- **3C — Detail view rebuild.** Product-style layout: `ModelHero` + `ModelGallery` (4:3 ~36% width) + content rail (`DescriptionPanel`, `ExternalLinksPanel`, `MetadataPanel`) + `SecondaryTabs` (Files STL-primary / Prints / Operational notes).
- **3D — Photos manager + DnD.** Admin-only `PhotosTab` (master-detail) with `@dnd-kit/sortable` reorder, set-thumbnail, delete, drag-drop upload. Backend `position` column on `model_file` + `POST /api/admin/models/{id}/photos/reorder`.
- **3E — Edit affordances.** Status / rating popovers (atomic). Side-sheets: description, tags (with create-new), prints, notes. Delete-model confirmation modal (typed-name confirm). All ✏ icons wired on Hero/DescriptionPanel/PrintsTab/OperationalNotesTab.
- **3F — Cleanup + ActivityTab.** Audit-log read endpoint `GET /api/admin/audit-log`. Admin-only `ActivityTab` showing per-model audit feed. Deleted orphan legacy frontend code (share view, gallery utilities, dead types, dead lib helpers).

### Active surfaces

- **Public read** (`/api/categories`, `/api/tags`, `/api/models`,
  `/api/models/{id}`, `/api/models/{id}/files`,
  `/api/models/{id}/files/{id}/content`) — serves real DB-backed data.
- **Admin write** (`/api/admin/*` for models, files, tags, categories,
  notes, prints, external_links) — JWT-protected; admin role plus the
  newly-enabled `agent` role can both call most endpoints.
  Hard-delete (`?hard=true`) is admin-only.
- **Share** (`/api/share/{token}` public; `/api/admin/share` admin
  CRUD) — UUID-based, reads from SoT entity tables; no legacy
  file-based path remains.

### Agent service account

A user `agent@portal.example.com` exists on `.190` with role=`agent`.
Provisioned via `python -m scripts.bootstrap_agent --email ... [--rotate]`.
Local credentials cached at `~/.config/3d-portal/agent.token` (chmod 600);
the `hydrate_local_tree.py` script reads it for re-auth.

### Reverse-sync

Run `python -m scripts.hydrate_local_tree --portal-url
http://192.168.2.190:8090 --target <local-dir> --token-file
~/.config/3d-portal/agent.token --kinds stl` from WSL to materialize
STLs locally. State is kept in `<target>/.hydrate-state.json` for
incremental updates. Layout:
`<category-slug>/<subcategory-slug>/<model-slug>-<8-char-uuid>/<original_name>`
(the 8-char suffix is the model UUID hex with dashes stripped,
truncated). **Note:** prior to E4.4-followup (2026-05-11) the suffix
was `legacy_id` (e.g. `001`, `002`) where present, falling back to the
short-uuid; post-DROP all models use the short-uuid uniformly.
Local trees rendered under the old scheme retain their pre-rename
directory names — either accept the layout change on next re-hydrate
OR run a one-time bulk-rename pass against the local tree before
re-running `hydrate_local_tree.py`.

### What remains

- **`audit_log.action` enum tightening** — currently the column is free
  `text`. The `KNOWN_ENTITY_TYPES` runtime guard prevents drift; future
  polish slice can convert to a strict `AuditAction` enum once the API
  mutation catalog stops growing.
- **3MF originals staging dir** — the migration imported from
  `/mnt/raid/3d-portal-staging/3mf-originals/` (300 MB). Removable.

### UI deferrals (post-3F follow-ups, not blocking)

- **Full-page `/admin/models/new`** for creating a model from scratch.
  Admin can use the API or the migration script in the meantime; the
  agent does most creates anyway.
- **`/admin/users` page** for member provisioning. Use direct SQL or
  the bootstrap script until then.
- **Side-sheets for ExternalLinks, Category picker, File metadata.**
  These edit paths are low-frequency; the API supports them directly.
- **Share view rebuild.** The share-create UI was deleted with the dead
  `ShareDialog`; resurrect both when sharing becomes a real flow.
- **Description "view source" toggle.** Source-original is currently
  overwritten in place; storing it separately would require a DB
  convention decision (column on `Model` or a flagged `ModelNote`).
- **Backup for `portal-content/`** — restic schedule per spec section 7.1.

## Post-cutover portal-self-auth posture (2026-05-20)

Initiative 5 closed at this commit. The edge cutover (Epic 10 Story 10.3,
sibling commit `dd0c7b8` on `~/repos/configs/`) dropped the server-level
IP allowlist on `https://3d.ezop.ddns.net`. Nginx is now a thin TLS
terminator + proxy layer — no longer an auth gate.

### Authentication

- The portal authenticates itself via cookie+JWT — `portal_access` 10min +
  `portal_refresh` 30d family rotation. CSRF via the `X-Portal-Client: web`
  header (Init 0 baseline preserved).
- The `member` role is invite-only: admin generates single-use invite
  tokens via the `/admin/invites` panel (Story 8.6 surface); recipient
  lands on `/register?token=` flow (Story 6.4 surface). Public sign-up is
  intentionally NOT exposed.
- The `agent` service account (Init 2) is preserved exactly: cookie+password
  flow unchanged, 2FA never forced (`Role.agent` excluded by fail-fast
  startup `RuntimeError` if added to `enforce_2fa_for_roles`).
- The `admin` role (Michał) stays admin-only — `current_admin` dependency
  enforces per-route on every admin endpoint.

### 2FA enforcement

- Per-role config-flag driven: `enforce_2fa_for_roles: list[Role]` in
  `apps/api/app/core/config.py` (default `[]`).
- Per-user override path via `users.force_2fa_enrollment` BOOLEAN flag
  (Story 8.4 admin force-enrollment endpoint).
- Eight single-use recovery codes generated once + stored hashed (Story 7.1
  Fernet-encrypted secret + `recovery_codes` table).
- TOTP enrollment + verify flow at `/settings/2fa` (Story 7.2 + 7.5).
- Recovery-code drill artifact for the operator runbook:
  `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2fa-recovery-drill-2026-05-20.md`
  (Story 7.6 NFR5-OBS-2 first slot, gitignored).

### Rate-limiting

Redis sliding-window protects the auth + share surfaces (Decision G + H):

- `/api/auth/login` — 5 attempts / 60s per IP (Story 6.6).
- `/api/auth/refresh` — 10 attempts / 60s per IP (Story 6.6).
- `/api/auth/register?token=` — 3 attempts / 60s per IP (Story 6.6).
- `POST /api/share/` per member — 20 creates / 24h hard cap; soft-alert
  log line at 10th create (Story 6.7 + Decision H).

### Cross-references

- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/security-audit-2026-05-20.md` —
  Story 9.4 Epic 9 audit signoff: gate-condition PASS, zero open
  Critical/High, 23 Mediums all mitigated, 0/3 accepted-with-rationale.
- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/cutover-smoke-2026-05-20.md` —

- `_bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/2fa-recovery-drill-2026-05-20.md` —
  Story 7.6 operator runbook drill.

### Trust boundary

The portal is now the sole authoritative authentication boundary. Any
direct LAN access via `192.168.2.190:8090` STILL bypasses nginx and SHOULD
NOT be used by clients (admin/agent excepted — operator uses LAN-direct for
maintenance; production traffic goes through `https://3d.ezop.ddns.net`).
The nginx `set_real_ip_from` trust boundary at `.180` (Story 6.6 Codex
fix-up) ensures the rate-limit middleware sees the real client IP, not the
nginx proxy IP, when computing the sliding-window key.

## Post-cutover portal-self-auth posture — Initiative 6 default-deny (2026-05-21)

Initiative 6 closes at this commit. Story 11.7 final rollback of the
temporary sibling configs IP allowlist (`70cb5ba` on `~/repos/configs/`,
reverted at `4be33d3`) re-establishes the cutover's primary product
property: portal authenticates itself via application-tier default-deny,
not via nginx perimeter restoration. Anonymous external requests now reach
the FastAPI app and receive 401 from `current_user` Depends — verified
end-to-end on 2026-05-21:

```bash
curl -sS -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://3d.ezop.ddns.net/api/categories
# → 401  (was 403 from temporary allowlist during Initiative 6 build window)
```

### Default-deny posture on `/api/*` (Initiative 6 Decision M)

The application route table is split between authenticated (`current_user`
/ `current_admin` / `current_member_or_admin` / `current_admin_or_agent`
Depends) and an enumerated `_PUBLIC_ROUTES` allowlist in
`apps/api/app/main.py`. Adding to the allowlist requires a Sprint Change
Proposal (FR6-AUTH-2 procedural gate). The CI-blocking pytest enumeration
test at `apps/api/tests/test_route_enforcement_gate.py` (Story 11.4)
asserts the property mechanically and runs in <1s.

Anonymous-allowed `/api/*` surface (exactly enumerated):

- `/api/health` — D-LOCK-3 nginx-LAN-only deferred to future cleanup
- `/api/auth/login` / `/logout` / `/refresh` / `/register` / `/2fa/verify`
  / `/password-reset` — auth endpoints (CSRF + rate-limit middleware)
- `/api/share/{token}` — share resolve (Init 0 contract)
- `/api/share/{token}/files/{file_id}/content` — share-scoped asset endpoint
  (Initiative 6 Story 11.2 Decision N hardened-(a)): token-scoped, kind-
  filtered (only image/print/stl surfaced; `source` + `archive_3mf` never
  exposed), soft-delete filter, uniform 404 on any failure (no enumeration
  oracle), Cache-Control: no-store, audit token-hash never clear token,
  path-token redaction in `logging.py`.

### Frontend shell-level AuthGate (Decision O)

`apps/web/src/shell/AppShell.tsx` hoists authentication gating from per-route
`<AuthGate>` wrappers to a single shell-level gate (Story 11.3). Anonymous
users on protected paths redirect to `/login?next=<path+searchStr>`; the
`searchStr` encoding contract (single-encode via TanStack Router) closes
hot-fix 64447ff's P2 codex finding (object-coercion `[object Object]`).
ModuleRail + TopBar absent for anonymous users — the login surface IS the
shell for anon principals.

### Audit re-run + trust restoration

Story 11.5 audit re-run produced `security-audit-2026-05-21.md` with
NFR6-SEC-1 gate condition PASS: **69/69 auth-boundary probe PASS, 0 FAIL,
zero open Critical/High, 0/3 accepted-rationale Mediums.** Scenario 4 of
`infra/scripts/audit-six-scenarios.sh` now enumerates the live route table
via `/api/openapi.json` (replacing the pre-Init-6 hand-maintained admin-only
target list that produced supplemental finding High-002 on 2026-05-20).

`infra/scripts/cutover-smoke.sh` extends with Scenario 5 (Story 11.6) — an
external-host anonymous probe verifying the application-tier default-deny
is load-bearing from outside the LAN+VPN trust boundary. Operator sets
`CUTOVER_EXTERNAL_PROBE_SSH=<host:port>` to enable the live verification
at cutover time; the SKIP path (no env var) is acceptable during the
Initiative 6 build window.

### Cross-references (Initiative 6)

Sibling configs revert commit: `~/repos/configs/` `4be33d3` (revert of
`70cb5ba`), deployed via sibling `sync.sh` 2026-05-21 — `.180` nginx
reloaded successfully; 3d.ezop.ddns.net no longer carries a server-level
IP allowlist; portal-self-auth is the sole boundary.

## Spoolman read-only inventory (Initiative 19)

Initiative 19 MVP-A ships a read-only mirror of the homelab Spoolman
instance at `192.168.2.190:7912`. The portal API caches the inventory in
Redis on a 60s arq poll cadence and surfaces it through three auth-
bearing API routes — `GET /api/spools/summary`, `GET /api/spools/spools`,
`GET /api/spools/filaments` (Story 31.2, all mounted under the
`/api/spools` prefix) — plus the `/spools` frontend index page and the
landing-page `LowStockCard`. Direct Spoolman UI usage on the LAN is
preserved by design — the portal does not own the Spoolman database,
and write surfaces are out of MVP-A scope (Phase C trigger).

### Environment variables

| Slot | Default | Purpose | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SPOOLMAN_URL` | `http://spoolman:8000` (Decision AE P4b — portal-api on the shared docker network resolves the `spoolman` hostname). Fallback `http://192.168.2.190:7912` (P4a — operator override when the configs-side network attachment slips). | Base URL the portal API uses for Spoolman's `/api/v1/*` endpoints. Empty value is invalid; the client raises at startup. | `apps/api/app/core/config.py` (Story 31.1). |
| `SPOOLMAN_AUTH_TOKEN` | empty | Reserved future Spoolman auth (Phase C trigger; not exercised in MVP-A). Empty value disables the `Authorization` header. | Same. |
| `SPOOLMAN_LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD_G` *(reserved slot name, NOT a real env var in MVP-A)* | **NOT IMPLEMENTED in MVP-A** — the current threshold is the hardcoded `LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD_G = 200` constant at `apps/web/src/modules/spools/components/LowStockCard.lib.ts`. | The "low stock" cutoff (grams; strict `<` comparator) below which a spool surfaces on the landing `LowStockCard`. | FE component-level constant. The `SPOOLMAN_*` prefix above is reserved for the day this is promoted — but the consumer is the **frontend bundle**, not the api container, so promotion is a Vite-build-time read, not a runtime env read. The single-file upgrade path: replace the constant with `Number(import.meta.env.VITE_SPOOLMAN_LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD_G ?? 200)` and add `VITE_SPOOLMAN_LOW_STOCK_THRESHOLD_G` to the same `.env` file consumed by `apps/web/Dockerfile`'s build stage (`.190:/mnt/raid/docker-compose/3d-portal/.env` + `~/repos/3d-portal/infra/.env`). Re-deploy required — no in-place runtime tuning, that would require a separate `/api/spools/config` runtime-injection path which is **out of scope** for MVP-A. |

### Soft-fail behavior

When Spoolman is unreachable, the portal degrades gracefully
(FR19-FAILURE-1) — NEVER 5xx:

- **`GET /api/spools/summary`** returns HTTP 200 with empty arrays +
  `last_success_ts: null` when both the cache is empty AND the live
  fetch fails (cold-cache + outage). When the cache is warm but
  Spoolman is currently down, the prior snapshot is served with the
  original (stale) `last_success_ts`; the FE indicator computes
  "Xm temu" from the delay.
- **`/spools` route** renders the explicit `EmptyState` "Spoolman jest
  nieosiągalny" with no Retry (the arq cron repopulates the cache
  automatically when Spoolman returns).
- **Landing `LowStockCard`** renders the same soft-fail empty state
  inside the card; the rest of the dashboard (hero + quick-link tiles)
  continues to render normally.

Cache topology (Story 31.1, byte-pinned keys — change requires SCP):

| Key | TTL | Owner |
|---|---|---|
| `spools:summary:v1` | 30s | `SpoolsService.refresh_summary()` writes JSON-encoded snapshot. |
| `spools:summary:last-success-ts` | no TTL | Sibling key; survives cache rotation so the FE staleness indicator can compute arbitrary delays. |
| `spools:poll-lock` | 90s | SETNX single-poller leader-election; only the lock holder calls Spoolman. |

arq poll cadence: 60s (FR19-CACHE-1 freshness budget; matches FE
`staleTime: 60_000` on `["spools","summary"]` queryKey).

### OD8 LAN-only bind verification recipe

Spoolman is configured for LAN-only exposure (operator decision
2026-05-29): NOT `0.0.0.0`, NOT `::`; explicitly bound to the host's
LAN interface `192.168.2.190:7912`. To verify the bind on `.190`:

```bash
docker inspect spoolman --format '{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}' | jq
# Expect: "8000/tcp": [ { "HostIp": "192.168.2.190", "HostPort": "7912" } ]
# REJECT:  HostIp: "0.0.0.0" or HostIp: "::"  (Docker default
#           all-interfaces exposure leaks Spoolman onto every
#           host interface).
```

If the bind drifts to `0.0.0.0` / `::`, STOP and escalate:

1. The Spoolman compose file lives at
   `~/repos/configs/docker-compose-recipes/spoolman.yml`.
2. The expected `ports` entry: `- "192.168.2.190:7912:8000"`.
3. Fix on the configs side, re-deploy via `~/repos/configs/sync.sh`,
   re-run the inspect above to re-confirm.

The bind invariant exists because the operator + phone consume
Spoolman directly on the LAN (printer pushes filament-usage updates
live); a strict `127.0.0.1`-only bind would break that workflow. The
configs-side coordination ownership is documented in the SCP
(`_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/sprint-change-proposal-2026-05-29-spoolman.md`
§4.5) — the 3d-portal repo does NOT carry the compose file (HC2 trip-
wire: portal never edits configs files).

### GlitchTip breadcrumb category troubleshooting

All Spoolman client calls emit a Sentry breadcrumb at category
`spoolman.client` (Story 31.1 AC-6). When triaging a low-stock card
error or a `/spools` 200-with-empty-arrays response in GlitchTip,
filter the event's breadcrumb timeline by:

```
category:spoolman.client
```

Breadcrumbs surface: `endpoint` (`GET /api/v1/spool` / `/filament` /
`/vendor`), `duration_ms`, `status_code`, and the failure level
(`info` on success, `warning` on `httpx.RequestError` /
`httpx.HTTPStatusError` / circuit-breaker open). Matching
structured-log records carry the same `event.action`
(`spools.client.call` / `spools.client.error` / `spools.poll.refresh`
/ `spools.poll.error`) + `labels.external_service=spoolman` for grep
filtering on the JSON log stream.

If GlitchTip shows ZERO `spoolman.client` breadcrumbs in an event's
timeline during an outage triage, that ALONE does not prove the portal
client is fine — the portal client emits breadcrumbs unconditionally on
every call attempt (success, failure, AND circuit-open short-circuit
which logs `error_class=SpoolmanCircuitOpenError`), so absence of
breadcrumbs has several possible causes that the operator should walk
through in order:

1. **No call attempted on the request path** — the FE rendered a
   cache-only response (`spools:summary:v1` warm + `staleTime: 60_000`
   not yet expired in TanStack Query), the request never hit the
   `SpoolsService.refresh_summary()` cold-cache fallback, so no
   `spoolman.client` breadcrumb was created. The arq poll job runs in a
   separate worker process — its breadcrumbs land on **its own**
   GlitchTip events, not on the FE-triggered event you are looking at.
2. **Sentry SDK disabled / DSN missing in the failing service** — if
   `SENTRY_DSN` / `VITE_SENTRY_DSN` is empty or `Sentry.init` did not
   run (build mis-config, env not propagated to the container), the SDK
   silently drops breadcrumbs. Confirm `apps/api/app/observability.py`
   initialisation in the api container logs and `release.ts` in the FE
   bundle.
3. **Auth-gated 401 short-circuit before the route handler runs** —
   anonymous traffic to `/api/spools/*` is denied at `current_user`
   Depends BEFORE the service-layer client call. No client call, no
   breadcrumb. Check the GlitchTip event's `route.pathname` and the
   companion api log line for `http.status_code=401`.
4. **Request routed to a different service entirely** — the page is
   surfacing an unrelated upstream (catalog, share, auth), the
   `spoolman.client` category is correctly absent because Spoolman was
   never called. Cross-check `service=web|api|render` tag.
5. **Diagnostic exhausted — switch to active probes for upstream
   state.** Once (1)-(4) are ruled out, absence of breadcrumbs has
   reached the end of its diagnostic value: it does NOT prove an
   upstream / DNS / docker-network failure. The portal client emits a
   `level=warning` breadcrumb on **every** non-success outcome
   including upstream failures — `httpx.RequestError` (network /
   DNS / connection refused), `httpx.HTTPStatusError` (Spoolman
   returned 5xx / 4xx), and `SpoolmanCircuitOpenError` (breaker open
   from prior failures). If the portal had actually hit an upstream
   problem on the event you are inspecting, the breadcrumb would be
   PRESENT with `error_class` populated, not absent. Absence only
   means no `spoolman.client` call was attached to this particular
   event — it is silent on whether Spoolman itself is healthy. To
   determine upstream state, use **active probes** on `.190`, not
   breadcrumb-absence inference:

   ```bash
   # From .190 (or any LAN host that resolves the bind):
   curl -fsS -o /dev/null -w '%{http_code}\n' http://192.168.2.190:7912/api/v1/info
   #   → 200 = Spoolman responding; non-200 / connect-refused = upstream is the problem.

   docker logs --tail 200 spoolman          # container live + recent activity
   docker inspect spoolman --format '{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}}' | jq
   #   → re-runs the OD8 LAN-only bind check above.

   docker exec -it 3d-portal-api-1 getent hosts spoolman
   #   → DNS resolution inside the api container's docker network; empty result
   #     = docker-network attachment slipped (Decision AE P4a fallback territory).
   ```

   These probes give a positive determination of upstream state. The
   GlitchTip breadcrumb stream is for confirming whether the **portal
   client** noticed (present = portal saw the failure; absent = no
   client call on that event); the upstream determination itself runs
   on the active probes.

Conversely, presence of a `category:spoolman.client` breadcrumb with
`level=warning` and a populated `status_code` / `error_class` IS a
strong portal-client signal: the breadcrumb's `endpoint` field
identifies which Spoolman path failed (`/api/v1/spool` / `/filament` /
`/vendor`), `duration_ms` distinguishes timeout from immediate failure,
and the structured-log record with matching `event.action` carries the
full traceback (filter the JSON log stream by
`labels.external_service=spoolman`). This presence-pattern — not
absence — is the correct breadcrumb-side proof that an upstream
attempt failed.
